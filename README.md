# Project-Boost

## Game Description
The gaming experience focuses on flying a rocket adorned with visual effects over challenging obstacles, and the main objective is to reach the designated finish point to progress to the next levels. The inclusion of core scripts, including Collision Handler and Motion, enhances gameplay by providing a variety of features to engage the player. Although the current version only consists of two levels, I aim to expand the content of the game by adding additional levels in future updates. Additionally, ongoing developments aim to introduce new features to both the rocket and the environment, promising an improved and enriched gaming experience in subsequent versions.
